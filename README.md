Quote prioritization for Underwriters

Concept:

Underwriters are well-familiar with parsing through CSV's and attempting to extract the most promising quotes - but often times there is large variance and opportunities.



### TODO
* Use regular table for list of quotes and their ranking - both the brokers list and the quotes list.
* Pre-approval indication or option in the UI for the highest profitable quote opportunities.
* Be able to click a row in the table and have a modal pop up that gives more information on the quote - including the ability to specify a quote value to be communicated back to the broker (submittable as a dollar amount). Decline is also an option, and you can kill it from the list.
* Check box column to be able approve a particular quote submission.
* Color code the rows for the brokers table as well.

### Components
* Be able to identify the brokers that excel at generating profitability for requests, as well as those that don't
* Float the most promising reports to the top
